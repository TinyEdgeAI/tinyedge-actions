# TinyEdge GitHub Actions

Run [TinyEdge](https://tinyedge.ai) on **real edge devices** from your CI — benchmark, validate, and pick the best quantized build of a model, on every change.

Both actions install the `tinyedge` SDK and call it; you supply a `TINYEDGE_API_KEY` secret and have a device online during the run.

| Action | Use | Docs |
|--------|-----|------|
| **[`decide`](decide)** | sweep the quant ladder on a device, pick the best variant for a deployment profile, emit a **signed manifest** | [decide/](decide/README.md) |
| **[`validate`](validate)** | benchmark a model vs a saved baseline and **fail the build on regression** | [validate/](validate/README.md) |

## Quick start — guard a model against regressions

The first run saves a baseline automatically; every run after that compares on
the same real device and **fails the build on regression**. With
`only-on-change`, a daily cron only spends device time when the Hugging Face
repo actually got a new revision:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/edge-check.yml
on:
  schedule: [{ cron: '0 6 * * *' }]
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: TinyEdgeAI/tinyedge-actions/validate@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.TINYEDGE_API_KEY }}
          model: "hf:your-org/your-model-GGUF/your-model-Q4_K_M.gguf"
          device: jetson-orin-nano
          only-on-change: true
```

To *choose* what to ship in the first place (sweep the quant ladder, pick the
best variant, emit a signed manifest), use `decide`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/edge.yml
on: { workflow_dispatch: {} }
jobs:
  decide:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: TinyEdgeAI/tinyedge-actions/decide@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.TINYEDGE_API_KEY }}
          model: "hf:bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF"
          device: jetson-orin-nano
          profile: max_quality
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: steps.decide.outputs.verdict == 'ok'
        with: { name: manifest, path: tinyedge-manifest.json }
```

## Versioning

Reference a stable major with `@v1`. Each action's inputs/outputs are documented in its folder.
